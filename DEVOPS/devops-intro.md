### 1. Introduction to DevOps

What is DevOps?
    - DevOps is a combination of Development (the process of creating software) and Operations (the process of managing and maintaining that software after it’s created).
    - It’s a way of working that helps developers and operations teams work together to create software faster and make sure it works well in real life.

In simple terms, DevOps is about making the process of building and running software smoother and faster by improving teamwork and using cool tools and practices.

### 2. Why Do We Need DevOps?

Before DevOps, the development and operations teams worked separately:

    Developers focused on writing the code and creating new features.
    Operations focused on making sure the software ran smoothly on servers.

This often caused problems, like:

    Developers created code, but it didn’t work well when deployed (put on servers).
    Changes took a long time to be added to the software, making it harder to fix bugs or add new features quickly.

Why do we need DevOps?
    - Faster Software Delivery: DevOps helps software get developed, tested, and released faster, so users get new features and fixes more quickly.
    - Better Collaboration: It helps developers and operations teams communicate better and work together, making the process smoother.
    - Quality & Reliability: It ensures the software is of high quality and works reliably after being released.


### 3. DevOps Lifecycle

The DevOps Lifecycle is the series of steps that teams follow to develop, test, and release software using DevOps principles. Here are the main steps:

    1.Plan:
        Before coding, the team discusses what needs to be built, who it’s for, and how to get it done.
        Tools: Jira, Trello (for planning tasks)

    2.Code:
        Developers write the software or features.
        They usually work in teams, and DevOps tools help them work together easily (e.g., Git for version control).

    3.Build:
        The code is then turned into something that can be run by a computer (compiled).
        Tools: Jenkins, CircleCI, Github actions

    4.Test:
        Testing ensures that the software works correctly and doesn’t have bugs.
        It’s important to test early and often to catch problems before they affect users.
        Tools: Selenium, JUnit

    5.Release:
        The software is released or deployed (put into use by users).
        DevOps ensures this step happens quickly and with minimal issues.
        Tools: Kubernetes, Docker

    6.Deploy:
        The software is placed in a real-world environment (like a website or app).
        Tools: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

    7.Operate:
        The software runs on servers and needs to be monitored to make sure it stays healthy.
        Teams check how it’s performing and make adjustments when needed.

    8.Monitor:
        After deployment, it’s important to monitor how the software is working.
        Tools: Prometheus, Nagios, Splunk, Elastic APM 


### 4. Core Principles of DevOps
    Collaboration:
        Developers and operations work together as one team, breaking down barriers.

    Automation:
        Repetitive tasks like building, testing, and deploying code should be automated (done by computers), so it’s faster and more reliable.
        Example: Automatically running tests whenever new code is written.

    Continuous Integration (CI):
        Developers should regularly (often multiple times a day) add their code to the project. This keeps the software up-to-date and makes sure no one’s changes cause problems.
        Example: Code is checked and tested as soon as it’s added to the project.

    Continuous Delivery (CD):
        Software should always be ready to be released at any time. Changes are made in small chunks so they can be quickly and easily deployed.
        Example: Releasing new features once they’ve been tested and ready, rather than waiting months.

    Monitoring and Feedback:
        Monitoring the software after it’s deployed helps teams understand how well it’s performing and if there are any issues. This allows the team to fix problems quickly.

    Security:
        Security should be part of every stage of development, from planning to deployment.

    
### 5. DevOps Goals

The main goals of DevOps are to:
    Speed
    Quality
    Reliability
    Scalability
    Security
    Collaboration


## Project management tools/methodologies

### 1. What is Agile?
- Agile is a way of managing projects that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and delivering value to customers quickly.
- It breaks projects into small parts (iterations) and allows for frequent changes based on feedback.
- Agile isn’t just one method, but a mindset that encourages flexibility and continuous improvement.
- Key Concepts of Agile:
    Iterative Process
    Collaboration
    Customer Focus

### 2. What is Scrum?
- Scrum is a framework within Agile that organizes work into sprints (short, time-boxed periods, usually 1-4 weeks).
- It includes specific roles:

    Product Owner (defines features)
    Scrum Master (facilitates process)
    Development Team (works on tasks)

- Key events include Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.


### What is Jira?
- Jira is a tool for managing tasks and tracking progress, especially in Agile and Scrum.
- It helps teams organize work, manage backlogs, plan sprints, and generate reports (like burndown charts).
