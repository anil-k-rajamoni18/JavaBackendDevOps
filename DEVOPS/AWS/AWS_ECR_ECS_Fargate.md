# AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) 

## üì¶ Overview
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** is a **fully managed container image registry** service by AWS.
- Enables developers to **store, manage, and deploy Docker container images** securely and at scale.
- It eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories or worry about infrastructure.

## üîë Key Features
- **Fully Managed**: No need to operate your own container registry.
- **Secure**: Integrated with AWS IAM and supports image scanning.
- **High Availability**: Regionally redundant storage.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Amazon ECS, EKS, and AWS Fargate.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales to meet your image storage and pull needs.

## üß± Core Concepts

### Repositories
- Containers are stored in **repositories**.
- Two types:
  - **Private repositories** (default)
  - **Public repositories** (via [ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws))

### Images
- Container images (e.g., built with Docker) are **pushed to/pulled from** ECR.
- Identified by tags (e.g., `my-image:latest`).

### Permissions
- Controlled with **IAM policies** or **repository policies**.
- Fine-grained access control for push, pull, and manage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Operations

### Push Image to ECR
1. **Authenticate** Docker to ECR:
   ```bash
    aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
    ```

2. Build and tag Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-image .
    docker tag my-image:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest
    ```
3. Push to ECR:
    ```bash
    docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest
    ```

4. Pull Image from ECR
    ```bash
    docker pull <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest
    ```

### üîí Security
- IAM Integration: Secure access control.
- Image Scanning: Detect vulnerabilities using Amazon Inspector or ECR native scanner.
- Encryption: Supports encryption at rest using AWS KMS.

### üîÑ Integration with Other Services
- Amazon ECS & EKS: Pull images directly from ECR for container orchestration.
- CI/CD Tools: Integrates with CodeBuild, CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

### üíµ Pricing
- Storage pricing per GB/month.
- Data transfer and image pull/push request charges.
- Free tier: 500 MB-month of storage (private repositories).


### üß∞ Usage of AWS ECR
1. Store Docker Container Images
    Push and pull Docker images using standard Docker CLI commands.

2. Deploy to AWS Container Services
    Integrated directly with:
        - Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
        - Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
        - AWS Fargate (serverless containers)

3. CI/CD Integration
    Seamless integration with:
        - AWS CodePipeline & CodeBuild
        - Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI/CD tools

4. Security and Scanning
    IAM-based access control
    Optional image scanning to detect vulnerabilities

### ‚úÖ When to Use AWS ECR
- Use AWS ECR if:
    - You're using ECS, EKS, or Fargate for containers.
    - You want tight integration with AWS IAM and CI/CD pipelines.
    - You need a scalable and secure solution without managing infrastructure.

# üîç What is Amazon ECS?
- Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a highly scalable container orchestration service provided by AWS. 
- It lets you run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances or using AWS Fargate (serverless).
        - Think of ECS as AWS's native alternative to Kubernetes.
        - You define task definitions (what containers to run), and ECS handles the deployment and scaling.

### ‚öôÔ∏è ECS Launch Types
- ECS supports two launch types:
```bash
| Launch Type | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2**     | You manage a fleet of EC2 instances where containers run. You‚Äôre responsible for scaling, patching, and networking. |
| **Fargate** | AWS manages the compute for you. No EC2 to provision or manage ‚Äî just define your container, and Fargate runs it.   |

```

### üîç ECS vs EKS ‚Äì Key Differences

| Feature                     | **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**  | **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Orchestration Engine**    | AWS proprietary system                      | Open-source **Kubernetes**                          |
| **Setup Complexity**        | Easier to set up, AWS-native                | More complex, aligns with standard Kubernetes setup |
| **Ecosystem Compatibility** | Limited to AWS                              | Kubernetes ecosystem: Helm, Istio, Prometheus, etc. |
| **Launch Types**            | EC2 or Fargate                              | EC2 or Fargate                                      |
| **Customization**           | Less flexible, opinionated AWS integrations | Highly customizable via Kubernetes config           |
| **Learning Curve**          | Lower ‚Äì easier to get started               | Steeper ‚Äì requires Kubernetes knowledge             |
| **Vendor Lock-In**          | AWS-specific                                | Open-source, easier to migrate across providers     |
| **Community & Portability** | Limited to AWS                              | Large global community and multi-cloud support      |

### ‚úÖ When to Use:
- Use ECS if:
    - You want a simpler, AWS-native solution.
    - You're working only within AWS and don't need Kubernetes-specific tooling.
    - You prefer less overhead and faster deployment.


- Use EKS if:
    - You need Kubernetes features or already use Kubernetes elsewhere.
    - You want to avoid vendor lock-in.
    - You need integration with Kubernetes-native tools like Helm, CRDs, or service meshes.

- ECS = Simple, AWS-native, fully managed, less flexible.
- EKS = Kubernetes-compatible, powerful, open, but more complex to manage.

# üöÄ What is AWS Fargate?
- AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both ECS and EKS (Kubernetes on AWS).
- You don‚Äôt manage servers or clusters.
- You specify CPU, memory, and the container image, and Fargate handles the rest.
- Pricing is based on the requested vCPU and memory resources per second.

### üîÑ ECS vs Fargate
| Feature            | **ECS (with EC2)**               | **Fargate**                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure** | You manage EC2 instances         | AWS manages compute (serverless)      |
| **Scaling**        | Manual or auto-scaling EC2       | Auto-scales per task                  |
| **Pricing**        | Pay for EC2 (even if idle)       | Pay only for actual task usage        |
| **Networking**     | More flexible/custom             | Simpler setup, less control           |
| **Use Cases**      | Long-running, resource-optimized | Short jobs, microservices, batch jobs |
